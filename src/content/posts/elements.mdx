# Text Formatting

Normal text obviously works, however specific formatting works as well.

Text can be **bold** or _italic_ (or a combination of ***both***).

[Hyperlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) work as expected[^1]

> That link leads to a special website by the way

Let that last point be ~~struck from the record~~

> Another aside to state that emojis are made accessible with proper screenreader tags: ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

# Images

Example of loading a remote image:
<Image src="https://github.com/PenPow/Sentry/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push" alt="Example image" width={205} height={20} />

```diff

+this is an actual diff file
-all contents will remain unmodified
 no whitespace will be removed either
```

```diff lang="js"
  function thisIsJavaScript() {
    // This entire block gets highlighted as JavaScript,
    // and we can still add diff markers to it!
-   console.log('Old code to be removed')
+   console.log('New and shiny code!')
