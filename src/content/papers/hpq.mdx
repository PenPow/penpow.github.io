# Introduction

Computing is one of the newest subjects on the curriculum. As we move to become a more tech focused society it is no coincidence that computer science is one of the fastest-growing subjects at GCSE, where computer science entries rose by 12% in 2023, above the average growth of 3% across all subjects (British Computer Society, 2023).   

However, while technology will play an ever-increasing role in our lives, the question remains as to whether the adoption of computing as a compulsory subject throughout primary and secondary education is helping to benefit the UK as a  whole .  

# Computing Education in the UK

Computing as a subject is new   and has developed as computers themselves have evolved. The modern subject referred to as computing was introduced in 2014 when it replaced the former curriculum under the name of ICT after a report in 2012 by the Royal Society found the ICT curriculum to be “highly unsatisfactory” (The Royal Society, 2012).   

The reason for this change was to create a new course less focused on “office skills,” the main criticism of the former ICT course. This refresh included a rebranding of the curriculum to use the term “computing” to refer to the three main subject areas: Information Technology, Digital Literacy and Computer Science.

The first branch, Information Technology, focuses on the use of computers in the workplace, along with project management. This makes it the most similar to the former ICT course, however for the purposes of this project it is not relevant to my question.

The second branch, Computer Science, focuses on both the theoretical (algorithms and data structures) and the applied aspects (programming and problem solving) of computing. Nowadays, when you mention the word “computing” or “computer science” this is what most people think of.

However, the third branch, digital literacy, is the most widely applicable to most people. It focuses on the ability to use computers effectively. This encompasses the organization and storage of documents, as well as how to efficiently use Google and other internet-based tools to complete tasks. 

Nowadays, students are taught computing throughout KS1-KS3. The national curriculum does not require computing to be taught as a subject during EYFS or KS4. However, during KS4 all students, including those not taking it as a separate GCSE, must be taught general digital literacy skills.

While computer science as a GCSE is widely available (as of 2018 79.2% of all students can study it at non-selective state schools ), the actual uptake is much lower, sitting at just 15.6% of all students at schools which offer computer science as a subject choice (Kemp & Berry, 2019). 

In addition to this, at KS4 the average lesson time for non-GCSE computer science digital literacy lessons averaged just nine minutes per week (Kemp & Berry, 2019).  Despite computing becoming a more widely available and important subject, the average (non-computer science GCSE) student is receiving little computing education. Overall, total hours of computing education at KS4 have halved compared to the levels in 2012, and similar drops are seen across KS3 and KS5 (Kemp & Berry, 2019).  

While for many people their computing needs are served well by the mandatory digital literacy elements , the benefits of studying the computer science elements are not to be understated. Considering how technology will be playing a vital role in our society in the near future, computer science education should continue to be extended so that more students are encouraged to take it as a choice at GCSE.

A follow up study  by the Royal Society in 2017 noted that 24% of girls and 17% of boys cited their reason for not studying computer science at GCSE as “not needed for future plans” (The Royal Society, 2017).   As I will elaborate on further later in this report, computer science education brings many skills often underdeveloped by the “typical” GCSE subject spread. However, these skills are often not recognised by students, and there is little attention given to these skills during subject selection. 

Furthermore another 55% of girls and 38% of boys cited “not interested in subject” (The Royal Society, 2017).   This shows that the mandatory digital literacy course needs to be expanded to involve more aspects of computational thinking  to develop the soft skills found in the more specialised computer science course.

## The Importance of Digital Literacy

Digital Literacy is one of the branches of computing taught throughout primary and secondary education in the UK, and notably is the only statutory [mandatory] part of the curriculum.

However, the current digital literacy curriculum does not do enough to keep up with the future usages of technology, nor does it encourage development of problem-solving skills.

> Digital literacy should be a fourth pillar of education, alongside reading, writing and maths
> 
> — House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2019

In a world which has ever expanding sources of information, fake news and disinformation has become a real issue, especially on social media. There were many examples of this during the Covid-19 pandemic. Between January and July 2020 fact checking organisations have reported on over 1500 posts on X (formerly Twitter) identified as making false or partially false claims (Shahi, et al., 2021).  However, the current curriculum does not focus on this issue at all. Just 2% of children have the digital literacy skills to identify fake news, and 53.5% of teachers surveyed believe that the current curriculum does not teach the skills required to identify fake news (National Literacy Trust, 2018). 

Today's children have grown up surrounded by technology their entire lives. However, the naïve assumption that children are “digital natives” is wrong. Digital literacy is often overlooked as something inherently understood by children as they have grown up around it, however children do not necessarily inherently possess a deep understanding of digital literacy (ICDL, 2014). 

The digital literacy pillar of computing can be improved by modernising and looking at the new technologies people should be aware about. During the coronavirus pandemic the general public was first exposed to the power of artificial intelligence outside of a theoretical example. This was when we saw the launch of the first Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI, and in 2022 we saw the introduction of DALL-E 2, an image generator using natural language.

Technologies such as these are increasingly powerful and are becoming more prevalent in day-to-day life, and so extending the curriculum to teach about the potential issues around artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence generated work should be added to improve the digital literacy course.

While not everybody is interested in going down the route of studying computer science, the need to have a comprehensive understanding of digital literacy is essential. However, the curriculum is not updated frequently enough to keep up with the pace at which the internet and computers themselves develop.

A refresh of the digital literacy course would help modernise it and ensure its relevancy. As the course nears ten years since its development, the internet and the world we live in has changed dramatically. By extending the digital literacy course students would be better able to adapt to the realities of the modern internet.

Furthermore, elements of the digital literacy curriculum could be intertwined into other subject areas. This allows for it to be applied to real life situations. For example, implementing it into a geography case study would allow students to apply their understanding and build further on their digital literacy skills to search for sources, and organise them effectively.

> Digital literacy is an essential tool that underpins other subjects and almost all jobs.
>
> — House of Lords Select Committee on Digital Skills, 2015

Nowadays digital literacy is no longer considered a “nice to have” skill, but an essential part of work life. As seen during the Covid-19 pandemic, where remote working became common, the ability to quickly adapt to new software and use it efficiently was essential.

By promoting a new and refreshed digital literacy course the younger generations will be better equipped to deal with the modern workplace. Having the ability to state that you are “tech literate” provides an advantage over other people as its now a key skill that employers are looking for in almost every job, even those that are unrelated to tech.

## Soft Skills: The Skills Taught by Computer Science

However, as fundamentally important as digital literacy is, I argue that it's not the most essential skill taught by the computing curriculum. There is a key skill that is primarily taught in the Computer Science course which is highly valued and useful in most jobs.

Computational thinking refers to being able to solve a complex problem by breaking it into smaller steps, abstracting the useless details away, and then designing a solution to it. These problem-solving skills are increasingly useful and sought-after yet often go underdeveloped by other  subjects that students choose to study.

The key benefit to computer science is the development of these computational thinking skills.  This approach can be utilised in most jobs, as almost all necessitate a degree of autonomy and critical independent  thinking and therefore the improved ability to define, evaluate and implement a solution is seen as a useful skill. Furthermore, these talents can be often applied to management positions, where leadership warrants extensive reasoning skills.

These skills are often underrepresented in the curriculum as they are only primarily touched on in maths.  Computer Science not only implicitly develops these skills through programming, but also explicitly through the teaching of computational thinking. For example, under the Edexcel GCSE Computer Science curriculum  , topic 1 is dedicated to this and unit 1.1 focuses on decomposition and abstraction.

> [Students should] understand the benefit of using decomposition and abstraction to model aspects of the real world and analyse, understand and solve problems
>
> — Pearson Edexcel, 2020

The four key areas of computational thinking are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms. Given any problem you break it into smaller and more manageable steps, identify patterns within the problem, remove unnecessary details, and develop a solution to solve this smaller problem.

This is a really valuable skill. The ability to split a large task into many manageable sub-tasks that have the detail abstracted away can be useful not just in programming, but in schoolwork, business and life in general.  

As an example, I used computational thinking to write this project. I began by splitting the task into the manageable sub-sections that I was interested in talking about, identified patterns in my points between them, and then worked my way through the project one chunk at a time. This helped to ensure that I never experienced burnout, and that I was always focused on the smaller task at hand, rather than obsessing about the big picture, until the jigsaw puzzles fit together.

And while computing is often viewed as incredibly STEM focused, it also encompasses creativity with its problem solving. In many ways computer science is equivalent to an artist's paint brushes and a blank canvas . Given a set of guidelines, the problem can be tackled and interpreted in many ways. This problem-solving skillset is only developed by the computer science aspect of computing, and therefore is not covered by the broader and more generally taught (and statutory) digital literacy module (Romero, et al., 2017). 

In my opinion, computational thinking is the most useful part of the computing curriculum, and yet it is underrepresented across the board. Problem solving is something that is useful in almost every area of life. Yet, because it is primarily only taught as part of GCSE Computing in KS4, most people miss out. 

I believe that computational thinking should be expanded so that it is covered more extensively and earlier within the computing curriculum and that it is introduced into other subjects so that it can be built on further. By extending the study of computing we are equipping young people with the skills to solve problems easily from a younger age, and this can be used to their benefit throughout the entirety of their lives, even in jobs outside of the tech industry.

# Conclusion

Overall, the need for computing has increased dramatically since the introduction of the new curriculum in 2014.

Nowadays, digital literacy is essential, not just in the tech sector, but across almost every role. However, the critical part of the computer science curriculum is the computational thinking, and it is this part that benefits students from childhood to old age. These problem-solving skills are viewed as valuable resources to employers and so improving computational thinking skills improves the ability of the younger generation to compete in the workplace. 

Computing allows for the development of key skills not developed across the remainder of the curriculum. Skills like this are best developed when young, and I would recommend that the computing course be extended and elements, such as the digital literacy and the computational thinking, be implemented into other subjects to reinforce their usage. 

The need for computing in the future cannot be fully stated, and the skills that computing brings cannot be understated. I believe that by extending the study of computing we will be directly equipping students with the skills they can use across all aspects of their life for the rest of their life.
